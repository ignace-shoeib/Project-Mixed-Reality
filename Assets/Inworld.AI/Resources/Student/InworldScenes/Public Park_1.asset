  description: Nice windy park. It is beautiful and relaxing. Perfect to calm down
    and get your mind off of things. It is full of chirping birds and impressive
    scenery to look at. It feels like a comforting place to get your thoughts together
    and open up. Here people meetup to have a conversation about their personal issues
    and problems. People tend to be more open about their personal issues in this
    environment.
